# Reinforcement Learning-based Bumble Dating Bot with AI Vision and ChatGPT Integration

This repository presents a comprehensive Python implementation of a Bumble dating bot that combines cutting-edge technologies to deliver an intelligent and interactive experience. By leveraging reinforcement learning (RL), computer vision, and natural language processing (NLP), the bot engages in seamless conversations with matches on the Bumble dating app.

## Features

- **Web Automation:** Utilizes the Selenium library for web automation, enabling interaction with the Bumble app.
- **AI Computer Vision:** Incorporates an AI vision model that intelligently recognizes and solves captchas, allowing for uninterrupted navigation.
- **ChatGPT Integration:** Leverages OpenAI's ChatGPT for generating contextually relevant responses, ensuring natural and coherent chat interactions.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Employs the Q-learning algorithm for decision-making, with a Q-table to store state-action values. This enables the bot to make informed decisions based on observed rewards.

## How It Works

1. **Selenium for Automation:** The bot uses Selenium for automating interactions with the Bumble website, including navigating through the site and performing actions like swiping.
2. **Bypassing Captchas:** Through computer vision, the bot can recognize and solve captchas, facilitating smooth login and usage.
3. **Engaging Conversations:** By integrating ChatGPT, the bot simulates human-like conversations, improving user engagement.
4. **Learning and Decision Making:** With reinforcement learning, the bot learns optimal actions (swipe right or left) to maximize rewards over time.

## Code Organization

The codebase is structured into classes to promote modularity and ease of understanding. Detailed comments are included to explain the functionality of each component, making it accessible for developers to modify and extend.

## Potential Applications

This Bumble dating bot provides a foundation for developing sophisticated conversational agents within dating apps. It demonstrates the integration of AI to enhance user interactions, from bypassing captchas with AI vision to simulating human-like conversations with ChatGPT.

## Customization and Exploration

Developers are encouraged to explore different aspects, such as RL algorithms, reward functions, and state representations, to extend the bot's capabilities. This repository offers a base for building AI-powered dating bots focused on delivering personalized and engaging experiences.

## Setup and Execution

Ensure the proper environment setup, including necessary API keys and libraries, to successfully deploy and utilize this AI-driven Bumble dating bot.
