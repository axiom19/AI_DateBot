# Reinforcement Learning-based Bumble Dating Bot with AI Vision and ChatGPT Integration

This repository features a sophisticated Python implementation of a Bumble dating bot, integrating reinforcement learning (RL), computer vision, and natural language processing (NLP) to facilitate interactive experiences on the Bumble dating app.

## Features

- **Web Automation:** Uses the Selenium library for automating interactions with the Bumble app interface.
- **AI Computer Vision:** Implements AI technology to recognize and solve captchas, ensuring seamless navigation.
- **ChatGPT Integration:** Leverages OpenAI's ChatGPT to craft contextually relevant responses for natural and fluid conversation.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Utilizes the Q-learning algorithm, with a Q-table to record state-action values, allowing the bot to make informed decisions based on accumulated rewards.

## How It Works

1. **Automation with Selenium:** Automates Bumble website interactions, including navigation and swiping actions.
2. **Captcha Resolution:** Uses computer vision techniques to identify and solve captchas, enabling continuous operation.
3. **Conversation Simulation:** Integrates ChatGPT to simulate human-like interactions, enhancing user engagement.
4. **Learning and Decision Making:** Applies RL to learn optimal actions (e.g., swipe right or left) to maximize long-term rewards.

## Code Organization

The codebase is organized into classes to enhance modularity and clarity. Extensive comments are provided to elucidate the functionality of each module, facilitating easy modification and extension by developers.
